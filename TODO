MRS CC16 core runtime:


  Unimplemented:
    ☐ CAN
      ✔ basic message sending @done (22-05-07 10:04)
      ✔ console output @done (22-05-07 10:45)
      ☐ wakeup
    ☐ ADC
      ☐ Read / use calibration curves
      ☐ automated sampling
      ☐ smoothing
    ☐ input pins
      ☐ pull up/down control
        code complete
      ☐ analog / digital modes
        code complete
    ☐ output monitoring
      ☐ voltage (AI_OUT*)
      ☐ current (AI_INA_*)
      ☐ driver sense (AI_SNS*)
      ☐ error / fault handling
    ☐ supply monitoring
      ☐ KL30
        ☐ inhibit outputs when supply missing?
      ☐ KL15
        ☐ sleep mode when KL15 low
      ☐ Vref
        ☐ qualify ADC outputs when reference out of spec?
          implies some way for inputs to know they are dependent on Vref
    ☐ NVRAM
    ☐ scripting
      ☐ TinyScript
      ☐ microvium
      ☐ others? partcl? jim?

  Test Harness:
    ☐ wire up outputs
    ☐ wire up inputs
    ☐ monitoring
    ☐ assertions

  Investigate:
    ✔ AI_AI_INA_OUT* - what is this? @done (22-05-07 10:04)
      Sensed output current
    ☐ Smaller libc - getting 1K "impure data" for reentrancy support
    ☐ not booting - browning out? power-off should drain supply?
    ☐ ETL - any application?

  Bugs:
   ☐ Fix PWM output <CC16/pwm.h>
